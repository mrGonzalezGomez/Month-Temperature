# Monthly Temperature Analyzer

## Overview

This C++ program is designed to analyze and report the temperature data over a year, represented by monthly average temperatures. It identifies the month with the highest temperature and allows the user to inquire about the average temperature of any month by entering the month's numerical order (1 for January, 2 for February, etc.).

## Features

- **Data Storage**: The program uses two primary arrays for storing data:
  - An integer array `meses` holds the average temperatures for each month.
  - A string array `mes` stores the abbreviated names of the months.
- **Temperature Analysis**: It iterates through the `meses` array to find the month with the highest average temperature.
- **User Interaction**: Allows the user to input a month number to get the average temperature for that month.
- **Output**: Displays the average temperature of the selected month and the month with the highest average temperature along with its temperature.

## How It Works

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes the arrays with predefined values for temperatures and month abbreviations.
2. **Finding the Maximum**: Through a loop, it compares each month's temperature to find the highest one.
3. **User Input**: The user is prompted to enter a month number.
4. **Switch Statement**: Based on the input, it displays the average temperature for the chosen month.
5. **Final Output**: Lastly, it displays the month with the highest average temperature and its value.

## Running the Program

1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (such as g++, clang++, or MSVC).
2. Save the code in a file with a `.cpp` extension, for example, `temperature_analyzer.cpp`.
3. Compile the program using your C++ compiler, e.g., `g++ temperature_analyzer.cpp -o temperature_analyzer`.
4. Run the executable, e.g., on Windows `temperature_analyzer.exe`, or on Linux/macOS `./temperature_analyzer`.

## Example Usage

```plaintext
Ingrese un mes: 4
Abril tuvo 29 grados
El mes con mayor temperatura es J con 45 grados
```

## Note

- The program currently uses a very basic form of user interaction and does not validate the input for correctness (e.g., non-numeric or out-of-range inputs).
- The month abbreviations in the `mes` array are represented by the first letter of each month in Spanish (Enero, Febrero, etc.).

## Enhancements

Future enhancements could include input validation, dynamic data entry for temperatures, and support for different languages or more detailed month names.
